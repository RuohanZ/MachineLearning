## 1.PCA & NMF
- (a) Normalize the features of the wine quality dataset (where applicable).
- (b) Run PCA on the normalized training dataset. (How many components were needed to capture at least 95% of the variance in the original data.)
- (c) Train two unregularized logistic regression models using the PCA and NMF dataset and predict the probabilities on the appropriately transformed test data.
## 2. Almost Random Forest
-  Each tree is built using a bootstrap sample and random subset of the features. (rf.py)
## 3. Gradient Boosting
