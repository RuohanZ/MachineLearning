## 1. Feature Extraction + Model Selection (q1.py)
- (a) Define your model assessment strategy that you will use for this dataset (Implement in the function model assessment.)
- (b) Build a vocabulary map (or dictionary) Identify all the words that appear in at least 30 e-mails in your training dataset (in function build vocab map.)
- (c) Construction of Binary Dataset: For each e-mail, transform it into a feature vector where the ith entry, xi, is 1 if the ith word in the vocabulary occurs in the email, or 0 otherwise. (function construct binary.)
- (d) Construction of Count Dataset: For each e-mail, transform it into a feature vector wherethe ith entry, xi, represents the number of times the ith word appears in the email. (funciton construct count.)
- (e) Construction of TF-IDF Dataset. (function construct tfidf.)
